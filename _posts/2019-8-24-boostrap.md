Hello world! This is my first “true” blog that I’m writing since starting my journey as a software engineer. A little background on me: I graduated from college in December of last year, and had decided before then that I wanted to pursue software engineering instead of my chosen majors, accounting and marketing. Since then, I have moved to San Francisco to be in the heart of the tech scene, and I’ve started a software engineering bootcamp called Hack Reactor that teaches students to be full stack javascript developers. I am currently on week three of twelve and here I am creating this small blog to talk a little about bootstrap.
So, why did I choose to talk about bootstrap to begin with? Well, the answer to that question is rather simple- I was assigned to create a simple CRUD app and wanted to make it look awesome without spending tons of time learning every CSS/HTML trick on the internet. Alas, I had heard about Bootstrap from a friend and realized that it could be something that I could easily implement into my app. Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains CSS- and JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components. So, understanding a little more about what Bootstrap is, you’re probably wondering how easy is this to actually implement? All it takes to get started is to add a few scripts to your CSS page to allow for Bootstrap to use some CSS and Javascript functionality and viola! You’re basically all set to get started.
The documentation for bootstrap is quite easy to follow, many of the customizable components include- badges, buttons, forms, alert, modals, fonts, and so much more! All of these are done using CSS flex under the hood so understanding the dynamic of the placement of components on a page is quite intuitive as well. As for the actual code, you can expect to be adding mostly HTML that does all of the work for you and makes your page look sleek and clean with just a line or two extra of code.

So, I provided a few photos from the documentation to show that Bootstrap can create some really cool looking components with a small amount of effort. There is definitely a lot more to Bootstrap so I suggest checking out the docs and seeing what else it can offer you!
